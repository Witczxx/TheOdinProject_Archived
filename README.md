# The Odin Project (Archived)
After working through parts of FreeCodeCamp, I decided to switch to The Odin Project.
<br><br>
During this time, I revisited and strengthened my HTML and CSS skills. 
<br>
I also built a small recipe website, being fully responsive on mobile devices.
<br><br>
However, while learning, I discovered the field of data analytics. 
<br>
I realized it is fitting much better to me. 
<br>
My background in healthcare has more value in the data field.
<br>
This direction feels both meaningful and exciting.
<br><br>
Thatâ€™s why I decided to archive this project and focus on data. 
<br>
So I started and completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate.
